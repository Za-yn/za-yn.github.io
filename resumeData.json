    "description":"My given name is Zhuang Yuan, but please call me Zayn. I am a firm believer that innovation is the way to effectively solve the worldâ€™s problems. Being a future computer engineer, my area of interest includes Augmented Reality (AR) and Computer Vision. I explore my interests in these fields by dabbling in mobile application development to solve problems that I encounter. During the summer of my junior year in University, I developed a prototype AR app to make furniture shopping easier for homeowners. Being mostly a front-end application only, I pitched the idea well enough to be voted the top three best project in the School of Computing in NUS. Now, I successfully attained an additional grant from the school to further my idea into a start-up and am collaborating with a furniture company to digitize their furniture in my next iteration of development.",
